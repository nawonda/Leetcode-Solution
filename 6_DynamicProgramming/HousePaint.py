There are a row of n houses, each house can be painted with one of the three colors: red, blue or green. The cost of painting each house with a certain color is different. You have to paint all the houses such that no two adjacent houses have the same color.

The cost of painting each house with a certain color is represented by a n x 3 cost matrix. For example, costs0 is the cost of painting house 0 with color red; costs1 is the cost of painting house 1 with color green, and so on... Find the minimum cost to paint all houses.

Note: All costs are positive integers.

Follow up: Could you solve it in O(nk) runtime?
